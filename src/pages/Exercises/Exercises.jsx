            it's important to choose exercises that are gentle and low-impact
            during the menstrual cycle, as the body may be more sensitive during
            this time.

                Cobra pose
              </h1>
              <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
                Begin on your belly with your feet hip-distance apart and your
                hands beside your ribs. Extend your big toes straight back and
                press down with all ten toenails to activate your quadriceps.
                Rotate your inner thighs toward the ceiling to broaden the lower
                back. Pressing down lightly with your hands, start to lift your
                head and chest, rolling your shoulders back and down. Keep the
                back of your neck long and focus on lifting your sternum instead
                of lifting your chin. Straighten your arms while keeping your
                shoulders remaining away from your ears. Keep at least a slight
                bend in your elbows. To exit the pose, release back to your mat.

                Pigeon pose
              </h1>
              <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
                First, position yourself in the upright sitting position. Bend
                your right knee, and extend your left leg behind you. Arch your
                back as you place your hands on your hips. A more intense
                stretch can be achieved if you reach your arms over your head
                and bring your hands together. Position yourself on all fours.
                Bring your right knee forward towards your right wrist, and
                extend your right ankle so it is in line with your left hip.
                Slowly slide your leg back. For balance and depending on your
                flexibility, you may need to keep your hands positioned on the
                ground. As your leg extends back, you will feel the stretching
                of your left hip and you may also feel stretching along your
                right side, but it shouldn't be painful. If it is painful, you
                may need to modify the pose. Hold this pose for several breaths
                before returning to the center and repeating the pose with your
                right leg outstretched behind you and your left knee bent.
                Repeat 5 to 10 times.

                Squats
              </h1>
              <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
                stand with feet a little wider than hip width, toes facing
                front. Drive your hips back—bending at the knees and ankles and
                pressing your knees slightly open—as you… Sit into a squat
                position while still keeping your heels and toes on the ground,
                chest up and shoulders back.Strive to eventually reach parallel,
                meaning knees are bent to a 90-degree angle.Press into your
                heels and straighten legs to return to a standing upright
                position.

                Lunges
              </h1>
              <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
                Start in a standing position with your feet hip-width apart.
                Step forward longer than a walking stride so one leg is ahead of
                your torso and the other is behind. Your foot should land flat
                and remain flat while it’s on the ground. Your rear heel will
                rise off of the ground. Bend your knees to approximately 90
                degrees as you lower yourself. Remember to keep your trunk
                upright and core engaged. Then, forcefully push off from your
                front leg to return to the starting position.
