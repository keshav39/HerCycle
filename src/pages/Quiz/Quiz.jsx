                <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-black text-justify">
                  During reproductive age, the majority of women and people who
                  menstruate have periods every month. But despite that, many of
                  us still have big gaps in knowledge where our menstrual cycles
                  are concerned â€” which is where our period quiz comes in. Take
                  this period test and see how much you know about your own
                  cycle. Knowledge is power, after all, and those gaps are there
                  to be filled with some fascinating period facts!

                    This quiz is designed to help you learn more about your
                    period and periods in general, but it is for educational
                    purposes only. Menstrual periods can differ for every person
                    and can often be irregular. If you're experiencing irregular
                    periods, uncharacteristically heavy or light bleeding, or
                    notice any other changes to your periods, contact your
                    health care provider for advice.
